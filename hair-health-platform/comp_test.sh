Excellent! Let's run some comprehensive tests to make sure everything is working correctly. I'll provide a structured test plan to verify all the authentication functionality.

## Step 1: Test Public Endpoints (Should Work Without Authentication)

```bash
# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health

# Test public test endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/public
```

## Step 2: Test Protected Endpoints (Should Return 401 Without Token)

```bash
# These should return 401 Unauthorized
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/hair-fall-logs
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/interventions
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/progress-photos
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/protected
```

## Step 3: Test User Registration

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser@hairhealth.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "username": "testuser"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJ...",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "email": "testuser@hairhealth.com",
    "username": "testuser",
    "isEmailVerified": false
  }
}
```

Save the `accessToken` for the next tests!

## Step 4: Test Login

```bash
# Login with the user you just created
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser@hairhealth.com",
    "password": "testpassword123"
  }'
```

## Step 5: Test Authenticated Endpoints

Using the access token from registration/login:

```bash
# Set your token here
ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token-from-registration"

# Test getting current user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/me

# Test protected endpoints (should now work)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/test/protected

# Test hair fall logs (should work but return empty list initially)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/hair-fall-logs"

# Test interventions (should work but return empty list initially)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/interventions"

# Test progress photos (should work but return empty list initially)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/progress-photos"
```

## Step 6: Test Data Operations with Authentication

```bash
# Create a hair fall log (should work with authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/hair-fall-logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2025-05-30",
    "count": 45,
    "category": "SHOWER",
    "description": "Normal shower hair fall"
  }'

# Create an intervention (should work with authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/interventions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "TOPICAL",
    "productName": "Minoxidil 5%",
    "dosageAmount": "1ml",
    "frequency": "Twice Daily",
    "applicationTime": "08:00, 20:00",
    "startDate": "2025-05-30",
    "notes": "Apply to dry scalp"
  }'

# Request photo upload URL (should work with authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/progress-photos/upload-url \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "filename": "hairline_progress_20250530.jpg.enc",
    "angle": "HAIRLINE",
    "captureDate": "2025-05-30T12:00:00Z",
    "encryptionKeyInfo": "test_key_12345"
  }'
```

## Step 7: Test Token Refresh

```bash
# Use the refresh token from registration/login
REFRESH_TOKEN="your-refresh-token-here"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/refresh-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"refreshToken\": \"$REFRESH_TOKEN\"}"
```

## Step 8: Test Invalid Token Scenarios

```bash
# Test with invalid token (should return 401)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/hair-fall-logs

# Test with malformed header (should return 401)
curl -H "Authorization: InvalidFormat token" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me/hair-fall-logs
```

## Step 9: Test Registration Validation

```bash
# Test registration with invalid email (should return 400)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "invalid-email",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "username": "testuser2"
  }'

# Test registration with short password (should return 400)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser2@hairhealth.com",
    "password": "short",
    "username": "testuser2"
  }'

# Test registration with duplicate email (should return 400)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "testuser@hairhealth.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "username": "duplicate"
  }'
```

## What to Look For:

✅ **Public endpoints work without authentication**
✅ **Protected endpoints return 401 without token**
✅ **Registration creates user and returns tokens**
✅ **Login works with correct credentials**
✅ **Protected endpoints work with valid token**
✅ **Data operations work with authentication**
✅ **Token refresh works**
✅ **Invalid tokens are rejected**
✅ **Validation errors are returned properly**

Run these tests and let me know:
1. Which tests pass/fail
2. Any error messages you see
3. Whether the token-based authentication is working as expected

This will help us verify that the JWT authentication is properly integrated with our existing API!
